# Rainfall-thresholds-for-landslide-forecasting-in-Chamoli-MadhyaPradesh
Probabilistic analysis using Bayes approach is considered to find out probabilistic rainfall thresholds.
Empirical rainfall thresholds are calculated using least square regression and data is fitted using power-law.
Empirical thresholds are also calculated using an algorithmic approach named CTRL-T(calculation of Thresholda for Rainfall induced Landslides Tool) which is done in R-software.
An algorithm-based model, Sistema Integrato Gestione Monitoraggion Allerta (SIGMA) isused for predicting the occurrence of landslides based on statistical analysis.
The derived rainfall thresholds were quantitatively compared using an area under the curve (AUC) based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve method with the help of confusion matrix.
Defining best model based on performance.
